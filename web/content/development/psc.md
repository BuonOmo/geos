The GEOS project is run by a Project Steering Committee made up of developers and contributors to the project and is a project of [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/geos/). Major project decisions are made via a [Request for Comments]({{< ref "rfcs" >}}) (RFC) process, where proposals are first documented and then voted on by the steering committee.

The current PSC will refresh itself using the mechanisms in RFC-1.
